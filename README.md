## Data Source Ideas


### Michael 

_Protein binding site classification_

Type: Binary classification

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hobako1993/sp1-factor-binding-sites-on-chromosome1

Using a 14-nucleotide sequence, determine whether the DNA region is a binding site for sp1. Likely needs to be split into 14 categorical features, that then need to be one-hot encoded (but how do we keep the ordering then? Similar to week 2 ideas with basis expansions with neighboring nucleotides? Maybe this would get learned regardless without)

_Skin cancer HAM10000_

Type: Image classification

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

This is probably too well-studied, but seems like an interesting way to combine images with structured data for classification (sex, age, skin area, etc.)

_Cartoon image classification_

Type: multiclass image classification

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/volkandl/cartoon-classification

Determination of cartoon image source (10 total) based on image data. Poking through some of the folders, it looks like many of the frames given might be duplicates or very similar, so judging performance might be difficult.
