## Analysis Ideas:




## Data Source Ideas


### Michael 

_Protein binding site classification_

Type: Binary classification

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hobako1993/sp1-factor-binding-sites-on-chromosome1

Using a 14-nucleotide sequence, determine whether the DNA region is a binding site for sp1. Likely needs to be split into 14 categorical features, that then need to be one-hot encoded (but how do we keep the ordering then? Similar to week 2 ideas with basis expansions with neighboring nucleotides? Maybe this would get learned regardless without)

_Skin cancer HAM10000_

Type: Image classification

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

This is probably too well-studied, but seems like an interesting way to combine images with structured data for classification (sex, age, skin area, etc.)

_Cartoon image classification_

Type: multiclass image classification

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/volkandl/cartoon-classification

Determination of cartoon image source (10 total) based on image data. Poking through some of the folders, it looks like many of the frames given might be duplicates or very similar, so judging performance might be difficult.





### Isaac

_Breast cancer classifaction in histopathology images_

Type: binary image classification

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images

High res images of breast biopsies cropped into smaller patches with corresponding cancer/no cancer label. Not sure how professor will view it since it's a kaggle competion with about 100 notebooks.

_Pathologic voice disorder classification_

Type: multiclass or binary audio classification

Link: https://www.physionet.org/content/voiced/1.0.0/

Time-series microphone recordings of subjects with voice diorders and without voice disorders.
