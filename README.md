## Data Source Ideas


### Michael 

_Protein binding site classification_

Type: Binary classification

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hobako1993/sp1-factor-binding-sites-on-chromosome1

Using a 14-nucleotide sequence, determine whether the DNA region is a binding site for sp1. Likely needs to be split into 14 categorical features, that then need to be one-hot encoded (but how do we keep the ordering then? Similar to week 2 ideas with basis expansions? Maybe this would get learned regardless without)

_Skin cancer HAM10000_

Type: Image classification

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

This is probably too well-studied, but seems like an interesting way to combine images with structured data for classification (sex, age, skin area, etc.)
